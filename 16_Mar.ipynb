Because of this, the model starts caching noise and inaccurate values present in the dataset, and all these factors reduce the efficiency and accuracy of the model. The overfitted model has low bias and high variance.he chances of occurrence of overfitting increase as much we provide training to our model. It means the more we train our model, the more chances of occurring the overfitted model.\n",

When this happens, the algorithm unfortunately cannot perform accurately against unseen data, defeating its purpose.Dropout is a regularization technique that prevents neural networks from overfitting. Regularization methods like L1 and L2 reduce overfitting by modifying the cost function. Dropout on the other hand, modify the network itself."
