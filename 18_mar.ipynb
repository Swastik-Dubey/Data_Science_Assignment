    "Q1: What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The Filter method is a feature selection technique that evaluates the relevance of features based on their statistical properties or information content. It operates independently of the machine learning model and assesses each feature's characteristics in isolation. Common techniques in the Filter method include correlation, information gain, chi-squared tests, and variance thresholding.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Here's how it generally works:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Compute a Score: Each feature is assigned a score based on certain criteria. For example, correlation coefficients, mutual information, or statistical tests may be used to calculate the score.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Rank Features: Features are then ranked based on their scores. Higher scores indicate higher relevance or importance.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Select Top Features: A predefined number or a threshold is used to select the top-ranked features for the subsequent modeling task.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The main advantage of the Filter method is its computational efficiency, as it doesn't require training a model."

    "Q2: How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The Wrapper method evaluates feature subsets by training a model on different combinations of features and selecting the subset that results in the best model performance. It involves the following steps:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Generate Feature Subsets: Create various subsets of features.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Train Model: Train a model using each subset.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Evaluate Performance: Assess the model's performance based on a performance metric (e.g., accuracy, F1 score).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Select Best Subset: Choose the subset of features that yields the best model performance.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Wrapper methods are more computationally intensive than Filter methods because they involve training a model multiple times. However, they can potentially identify interactions between features that Filter methods might miss."

    "Embedded feature selection methods incorporate feature selection as an integral part of the model training process. Some common techniques include:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator): LASSO adds a penalty term to the linear regression cost function, encouraging the model to use fewer features.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "Independence Assumption: The Filter method evaluates features independently, which may overlook interactions or dependencies between features.\r\n",

    "Large Datasets: When dealing with large datasets, computing statistics for each feature is computationally less expensive than training models multiple times.\r\n",

    "High-Dimensional Data: In cases where the number of features is much larger than the number of samples, filter methods can be more stable.\r\n",
