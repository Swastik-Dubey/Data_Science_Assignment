    "Q1. Explain the difference between linear regression and logistic regression models. Provide an example of a scenario where logistic regression would be more appropriate.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Linear regression is used for predicting a continuous outcome, while logistic regression is used for predicting the probability of an event occurring (binary outcome) based on one or more independent variables.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Example:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Linear Regression: Predicting house prices based on features like size, number of bedrooms, and location.\r\n",

    "Q2. What is the cost function used in logistic regression, and how is it optimized?\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function in logistic regression is the binary cross-entropy loss. It measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual labels. The goal is to minimize this cost function during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization is typically done using iterative optimization algorithms like gradient descent. The algorithm adjusts the model parameters iteratively in the direction that minimizes the cost function."

    "Q3. Explain the concept of regularization in logistic regression and how it helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization is used to prevent overfitting by penalizing the model for having large coefficients. In logistic regression, two common regularization terms are L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 regularization adds the absolute values of the coefficients to the cost function, encouraging sparsity. L2 regularization adds the squared values of the coefficients, preventing them from becoming too large."

    "Q4. What is the ROC curve, and how is it used to evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a graphical representation of the trade-off between true positive rate (sensitivity) and false positive rate (1-specificity) at various thresholds.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) is a commonly used metric to evaluate the discriminatory power of a logistic regression model. A higher AUC-ROC indicates better model performance."
