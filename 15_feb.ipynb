    "Ans.Multiprocessing in Python is a built-in package that allows the system to run multiple processes simultaneously. It will enable the breaking of applications into smaller threads that can run independentlyMultiprocessing is used to create a more reliable system, whereas multithreading is used to create threads that run parallel to each other. multithreading is quick to create and requires few resources, whereas multiprocessing requires a significant amount of time and specific resources to create."
