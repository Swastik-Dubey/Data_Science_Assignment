M is the slope or the consistent change between x and y, and b is the y-intercept. Often, the y-intercept represents the starting point of the equation.The slope indicates the steepness of a line and the intercept indicates the location where it intersects an axis. The slope and the intercept define the linear relationship between two variables, and can be used to estimate an average rate of change."
