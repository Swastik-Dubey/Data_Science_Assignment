    "# Q.2) Which type of programming does python support?\n",
    "### Ans. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including: \n",
    "1)Imperative Programming: This involves giving the computer a sequence of tasks to perform, using statements that change a program's state.\n",
    "2_Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): This is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code that manipulates that data.\n",
    "3)Functional Programming: This is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.\n",
    "4)Procedural Programming: This is a programming paradigm based on the concept of procedures, which are functions that operate on data.\n",
    "Python's design philosophy prioritizes readability and ease of use, and it provides constructs that support these paradigms and others, making it a versatile and flexible language for a wide range of applications."

This will take you to the page where the different Python releases for Windows can be found. Since I am using a 64bit system, I’ll select “Windows x86-64 executable installer”.Once the executable file download is complete, you can open it to install Python.Click on Run, which will start the installation process.If you want to save the installation file in a different location, click on Customize installation; otherwise, continue with Install Now. Also, select the checkbox at the bottom to Add Python 3.7 to PATH.Once the installation is complete, the below pop-up box will appear: Setup was successful."
