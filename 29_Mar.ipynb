    "Lasso Regression, also known as L1 regularization, is a linear regression method that adds a penalty term to the sum of squared residuals in the regression model, proportional to the L1 norm of the coefficients. The penalty term acts to shrink the coefficient estimates towards zero, effectively performing feature selection by setting some of the coefficients to exactly zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other regression techniques, such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, Ridge Regression, or Elastic Net, Lasso Regression has the following distinct features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection: Lasso Regression can effectively select important features from a large set of predictors by shrinking the coefficients of less important features to zero. This is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets, where the number of predictors is much larger than the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse solutions: Because Lasso Regression sets some of the coefficients exactly to zero, it can result in a sparse model, where only a subset of the predictors are included in the final model. This can improve the interpretability of the model and reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias-variance trade-off: Lasso Regression can be used to balance the trade-off between bias and variance in the model by controlling the amount of regularization through the tuning parameter (lambda). As lambda increases, the model becomes more biased but has lower variance, and as lambda decreases, the model becomes less biased but has higher variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-differentiability: Lasso Regression is non-differentiable at zero, which can make it more challenging to optimize than Ridge Regression, which is differentiable everywhere. This can lead to difficulties in choosing the optimal value of lambda and can result in some instability in the coefficient estimates when lambda is close to zero.\n",

    "In summary, Lasso Regression is a linear regression method that adds a penalty term proportional to the L1 norm of the coefficients, which allows it to perform feature selection and produce sparse solutions. It balances the trade-off between bias and variance through the tuning parameter, and its non-differentiability at zero can make it more challenging to optimize than other regression techniques."

However, if the value of lambda is too large, the model may underfit the data by removing important predictors from the model.\n",

For example, if the relationship between the predictor and the outcome variable is known to be quadratic, cubic, or higher order, the predictor can be transformed by squaring, cubing, or raising it to higher powers, respectively. These transformed predictors can then be included in the Lasso Regression model to capture the non-linear relationship between the predictors and the outcome variable."

    "Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression are two commonly used regularization techniques in linear regression that can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance. Here are some key differences between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Penalty term: Both Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression add a penalty term to the linear regression objective function, but they use different types of penalty terms. Ridge Regression adds the L2 norm of the coefficients (i.e., the sum of the squares of the coefficients), while Lasso Regression adds the L1 norm of the coefficients (i.e., the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients).\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection of variables: Ridge Regression does not perform variable selection, as it shrinks all the coefficients towards zero but does not set any of them to exactly zero. Lasso Regression, on the other hand, can perform variable selection, as it can set some of the coefficients exactly to zero, effectively removing the corresponding predictors from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution uniqueness: In Ridge Regression, the solution is always unique, as the penalty term ensures that the coefficients are not infinite. In Lasso Regression, the solution may not be unique, as the L1 norm can lead to some coefficients being exactly zero, resulting in multiple sets of coefficients that achieve the same level of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance on multicollinearity: Ridge Regression performs well when there is multicollinearity among the predictors, as it shrinks the coefficients towards zero, reducing their influence on the model's output. Lasso Regression may not perform as well when there is multicollinearity among the predictors, as it may arbitrarily select one of the correlated predictors and set the coefficients of the others to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Ridge Regression is computationally simpler than Lasso Regression, as it involves solving a linear equation with a unique solution. Lasso Regression, on the other hand, involves solving an optimization problem with a non-convex constraint, which can be more computationally expensive and require more advanced optimization techniques."

In the presence of multicollinearity, Lasso Regression may arbitrarily select one of the correlated predictors and set the coefficients of the others to zero, which can result in instability or poor performance of the model.\n",

This process is repeated for different values of lambda, and the lambda that gives the best performance is chosen.\n",
