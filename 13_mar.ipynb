    "Normality: The dependent variable should be approximately normally distributed within each group.\r\n",
    "Homogeneity of Variance (Homoscedasticity): The variances of the groups should be approximately equal.\r\n",

    "Homogeneity of Variance Violation: Unequal variances can lead to biased standard errors and affect the validity of the F-test. Robust ANOVA techniques or transformations may be used.\r\n",
    "Independence Violation: If observations are not independent, it can lead to pseudoreplication, and the F-test may be overly optimistic. This may be addressed through proper study design or statistical methods for repeated measures."
